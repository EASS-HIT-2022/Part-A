The EASS course at HIT, taught by Yossi Eliaz, covers essential topics in modern software development. Students learn command line, Bash scripting, AWS fundamentals, Git/GitHub, HTTP/REST API concepts, microservices architecture, Docker, frontend/backend development, software testing, CI/CD, and profiling/compiling. Each student builds a full product with three services (frontend, backend, and a third, usually a DB).
